# Photon Energy Calculator

## Overview

This Python script serves as a tool to calculate the energy of a photon based on user-input frequency. The script utilizes Planck's constant, providing an educational insight into the relationship between frequency and energy in quantum mechanics.

## Instructions

1. Run the script in a Python environment.
2. Follow the prompt to input the frequency of the photon.
3. The script will then compute and display the energy of the photon.

## Example

```bash
$ python photon_energy_calculator.py
Enter the photon's frequency here (in Hz):
Frequency: 3.0e10

The energy of the photon is: 1.9878e-24
